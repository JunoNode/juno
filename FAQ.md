# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ covers core details about how Juno works, what it’s built with, and how to get involved.

---

### Is Juno a wallet?
No. Juno connects to existing wallets like Phantom. It doesn't hold funds, it observes, analyzes, and responds based on your connected activity.

---

### Does Juno support Solana only?
Yes, Juno is built around the Solana ecosystem. EVM support is not a priority right now.

---

### What is the Grove?
The Grove is Juno’s AI interface. You can ask questions, check risks, or get insight all grounded in your wallet and market data.

---

### How does the alert system work?
Juno watches for patterns like mintable tokens, paused trading, or stealth liquidity. It scores the risk and surfaces alerts only when needed.

---

### Is my wallet data stored?
No. Juno uses live session context only, nothing is stored on a server. Memory exists for your session, not beyond it.

---

### Can I contribute?
Yes. Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to get involved, open issues, or suggest features.
