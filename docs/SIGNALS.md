# ðŸ“¡ Signal Reference

Juno surfaces alerts with calm priority â€” hereâ€™s what each type means:

- `token_mintable`: Token contract allows minting
- `trading_paused`: Transfers frozen or blocked
- `new_liquidity`: Token just received LP on Solana DEX
- `wallet_activity_spike`: Tracked address shows burst in transactions

Each signal is scored and surfaced based on risk logic.
